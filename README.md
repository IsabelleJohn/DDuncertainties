# DDuncertainties
This code calculates an uncertainty band for exclusion limits of dark matter direct detection experiments (e.g. LUX), based on uncertainties coming from the uncertainties in the position of the Sun, the escape velocity of the Galaxy, and the local dark matter distribution, obtained from the analysis in arXiv:1901.02460.
More information about the assumptions and methods, and the result of this plot can be found in [link to thesis].
